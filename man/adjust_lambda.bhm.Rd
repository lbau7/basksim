\usage{
\method{adjust_lambda}{bhm}(
  design,
  n,
  p1 = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  design_params = list(),
  iter = 1000,
  n_mcmc = 10000,
  prec_digits = 3,

}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object created with one of the \code{setup} functions.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{alpha}{The one-sided significance level.}

\item{design_params}{A list of params that is specific to the class of
\code{design}.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

\item{n_mcmc}{Number of MCMC samples.}

\item{prec_digits}{Number of decimal places that are considered when
adjusting lambda.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. Has to be generated with \code{get_data}. If \code{data} is used,
then \code{iter} is ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A list containing the greatest estimated value for \code{lambda} with
\code{prec_digits} decimal places which controls the family wise error rate
at level \code{alpha} (one-sided) and the estimated family wise error rate
for the estimated \code{lambda}.
