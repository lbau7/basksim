\usage{
\method{get_results}{fujikawa}(
  design,
  n,
  p1,
  lambda,
  epsilon,
  tau,
  logbase = exp(1),
  iter = 1000,
  data = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{fujikawa}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{epsilon}{Tuning parameter that determines the amount of borrowing.
See \code{\link{setup_fujikawa}}).}

\item{tau}{Tuning parameter that determines how similar the baskets
have to be that borrowing occur. See \code{\link{setup_fujikawa}}).}

\item{logbase}{Tuning parameter. The base of the logarithm that is used to
calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. If \code{data} is used, then \code{iter} and \code{p1} are ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A matrix of results with \code{iter} rows. A 0 means, that the
null hypothesis that the response probability exceeds \code{p0} was not
rejected, a 1 means, that the null hypothesis was rejected.
