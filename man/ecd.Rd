\usage{
ecd(
  design,
  n,
  p1,
  lambda,
  design_params = list(),
  iter = 1000,
  data = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object created with one of the \code{setup} functions.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{design_params}{A list of params that is specific to the class of
\code{design}.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. Has to be generated with \code{get_data}. If \code{data} is used,
then \code{iter} is ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A numeric value.
