}
\arguments{
\item{k}{The number of baskets.}

\item{p0}{A common probability under the null hypothesis.}

\item{shape1}{First common shape parameter of the beta prior.}

\item{shape2}{Second common shape parameter of the beta prior.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{cpplim}
}
\description{
Setup Limited Calibrated Power Prior Design Object
}
\details{
The class \code{cpplim} implements a combined version of the adaptive power
prior (\code{app}) and the calibrated power prior (\code{cpp}), where the
parameter limiting the amount of information to be borrowed in the adaptive
power prior design is included in the calibrated power prior design.
