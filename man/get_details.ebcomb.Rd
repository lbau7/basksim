\title{Get Details of a Basket Trial Simulation with the ebcomb Design}
\usage{
\method{get_details}{ebcomb}(
  design,
  n,
  p1 = NULL,
  lambda,
  level = 0.95,
  iter = 1000,
  data = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{ebcomb}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{level}{Level of the credibility intervals.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. Has to be generated with \code{get_data}. If \code{data} is used,
then \code{iter} is ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A list containing the rejection probabilites, posterior means,
mean squared errors and mean limits of HDI intervals for all baskets as well
as the family-wise error rate.
