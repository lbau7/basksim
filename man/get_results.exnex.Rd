\usage{
\method{get_results}{exnex}(
  design,
  n,
  p1 = NULL,
  lambda,
  tau_scale,
  w,
  iter = 1000,
  n_mcmc = 10000,
  data = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{exnex}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{tau_scale}{Standard deviation of the half normal prior exchangeability
distribution for the variance of the thetas.}

\item{w}{Fixed prior weight for the exchangeability part of the model.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

\item{n_mcmc}{Number of MCMC samples.}

\item{data}{An object of class \code{scenario_list} as returned by the
function \code{bhmbasket::simulateScenarios}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A matrix of results with \code{iter} rows. A 0 means, that the
null hypothesis that the response probability exceeds \code{p0} was not
rejected, a 1 means, that the null hypothesis was rejected.
