\title{Get Results for Simulation of a Basket Trial with the BMA Design}
\usage{
\method{get_results}{bma}(design, n, p1 = NULL, lambda, pmp0, iter = 1000, data = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{bma}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{pmp0}{Power parameter that is used to compute prior probabilities. See
\code{\link[bmabasket]{bma}} for details.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. Has to be generated with \code{get_data}. If \code{data} is used,
then \code{iter} is ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A matrix of results with \code{iter} rows. A 0 means, that the
null hypothesis that the response probability exceeds \code{p0} was not
rejected, a 1 means, that the null hypothesis was rejected.
