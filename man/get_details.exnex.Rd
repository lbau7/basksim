\item{tau_scale}{Standard deviation of the half normal prior exchangeability
distribution for the variance of the thetas.}

\item{w}{Fixed prior weight for the exchangeability part of the model.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation. Is ignored if
\code{data} is specified.}

function \code{bhmbasket::simulateScenarios}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{

mean squared errors and mean limits of HDI intervals for all baskets as well
as the family-wise error rate.
