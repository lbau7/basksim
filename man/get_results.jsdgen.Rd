Based on Generalized JSD Weights}
\usage{
\method{get_results}{jsdgen}(
  design,
  n,
  p1,
  lambda,
  eps_pair,
  eps_all,
  logbase = 2,
  iter = 1000,
  data = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{jsdgen}.}

\item{n}{The sample size per basket.}

\item{p1}{Probabilities under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{lambda}{The posterior probability threshold.}

\item{eps_pair}{Tuning parameter that determines the amount of borrowing
based on pairwise similarity.}

\item{eps_all}{Tuning parameter that determines the amount of borrowing
based on overall heterogeneity.}

\item{logbase}{Tuning parameter. The base of the logarithm that is used to
calculate the Jensen-Shannon divergence.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations in the simulation.}

\item{data}{A data matrix with k column with the number of responses for each
basket. If \code{data} is used, then \code{iter} and \code{p1} are ignored.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}
}
\value{
A matrix of results with \code{iter} rows. A 0 means, that the
null hypothesis that the response probability exceeds \code{p0} was not
rejected, a 1 means, that the null hypothesis was rejected.
