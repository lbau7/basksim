#' @param algorithm A function returning the optimization algorithm's results,
#' should have the form `algorithm(fun, trace, ...)`, where `fun` is the
#' function to be optimized, `trace` is a logical for requesting algorithm
#' trace, and `...` may be further parameters of the optimization algorithm.
